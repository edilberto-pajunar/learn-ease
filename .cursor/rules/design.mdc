# Design System Rules

## Core Principles

This is a learning-focused web application that combines book-style aesthetics with interactive, creative design elements to create an engaging reading and learning experience.

## Book-Style Design

- **Page-like layouts** - Create content areas that resemble book pages with:
  - Subtle paper texture backgrounds (use `bg-stone-50`, `bg-amber-50`, or `bg-cream` tones)
  - Page margins and gutters that mimic book pages
  - Typography that evokes reading a physical book (serif fonts for body text, appropriate line-height)
  - Page turn animations and transitions where appropriate
- **Reading experience** - Design content areas with:
  - Comfortable reading width (max-width: ~65-75ch for optimal readability)
  - Generous line spacing (line-height: 1.6-1.8)
  - Soft shadows and depth to create layered page effects
  - Bookmark-style navigation elements
- **Book aesthetics** - Incorporate visual elements like:
  - Decorative borders or dividers that resemble book edges
  - Chapter/section headers styled like book chapters
  - Page numbers or progress indicators styled as book pages

## Interactive Design

- **Smooth animations and transitions** - Use Tailwind's transition utilities:
  - `transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out` for interactive elements
  - Hover effects: `hover:scale-105`, `hover:shadow-lg`, `hover:bg-opacity-80`
  - Focus states: `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2` for accessibility
- **Interactive feedback** - All clickable elements must provide visual feedback:
  - Buttons: scale, shadow, or color changes on hover/active
  - Cards: lift effect on hover (`hover:-translate-y-1 hover:shadow-xl`)
  - Links: underline animations or color transitions
- **Micro-interactions** - Add delightful details:
  - Loading states with smooth animations
  - Success/error states with animated icons
  - Progress indicators with smooth transitions
  - Page transitions that feel natural
- **Engagement elements**:
  - Interactive tooltips and popovers
  - Expandable sections with smooth accordion animations
  - Drag-and-drop interactions where appropriate
  - Scroll-triggered animations for content reveal

## Creative Design Elements

- **Visual interest** - Balance creativity with readability:
  - Use creative layouts that break traditional grid patterns when appropriate
  - Incorporate decorative elements (borders, dividers, icons) that enhance the book theme
  - Add subtle patterns or textures that complement the book aesthetic
  - Use creative typography hierarchy (mixing font weights, sizes, styles)
- **Depth and dimension**:
  - Layered shadows to create depth (`shadow-sm`, `shadow-md`, `shadow-lg`)
  - Subtle borders and outlines for definition
  - Background variations to create visual separation
- **Creative components**:
  - Bookmark-style tabs or navigation
  - Page curl effects on cards or content sections
  - Animated book covers or illustrations
  - Creative progress indicators (e.g., reading progress bars styled as bookmarks)

## Color Palette

- **Use only TWO primary colors throughout the application**
- Choose colors that support learning and readability while maintaining book aesthetics
- Consider warm, paper-like tones for backgrounds (cream, beige, soft browns)
- Maintain consistent color usage across all components
- Use shades/tints of the primary colors for variations when needed
- Add subtle accent colors for interactive elements and highlights

## Styling Guidelines

- **NO linear gradients** - use solid colors only
- **Use className only** for styling - leverage Tailwind CSS utility classes
- **NO inline styles or style objects** unless absolutely necessary
- Keep designs clean and uncluttered while maintaining creative, engaging elements
- Balance book-style aesthetics with modern interactive design

## Icons

- **Use icon packages only** (e.g., lucide-react, react-icons, heroicons)
- **DO NOT create custom SVG icons**
- Import icons from established packages
- Maintain consistent icon sizing and styling
- Add subtle animations to icons on hover/interaction

## Responsive Design

- **Mobile-first approach** required
- Ensure full responsiveness across:
  - **Mobile**: 320px - 767px
  - **Tablet**: 768px - 1023px
  - **Desktop**: 1024px and above
- Use Tailwind responsive prefixes: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, `2xl:`
- Test layouts at all breakpoints
- Ensure touch-friendly interactions on mobile/tablet
- Adapt book-style elements for smaller screens (simplified page layouts on mobile)

## Component Structure

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Maintain clear hierarchy for learning materials
- Prioritize readability with appropriate spacing and typography
- Ensure consistent padding and margins across breakpoints
- Incorporate interactive and creative elements that enhance the learning experience
