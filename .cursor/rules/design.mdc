# Design System Rules

## Core Principles

This is a learning-focused web application that prioritizes clarity, accessibility, and simplicity.

## Color Palette

- **Use only TWO primary colors throughout the application**
- Choose colors that support learning and readability
- Maintain consistent color usage across all components
- Use shades/tints of the primary colors for variations when needed

## Styling Guidelines

- **NO linear gradients** - use solid colors only
- **Use className only** for styling - leverage Tailwind CSS utility classes
- **NO inline styles or style objects** unless absolutely necessary
- Keep designs clean and uncluttered to support focus on learning content

## Icons

- **Use icon packages only** (e.g., lucide-react, react-icons, heroicons)
- **DO NOT create custom SVG icons**
- Import icons from established packages
- Maintain consistent icon sizing and styling

## Responsive Design

- **Mobile-first approach** required
- Ensure full responsiveness across:
  - **Mobile**: 320px - 767px
  - **Tablet**: 768px - 1023px
  - **Desktop**: 1024px and above
- Use Tailwind responsive prefixes: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, `2xl:`
- Test layouts at all breakpoints
- Ensure touch-friendly interactions on mobile/tablet

## Component Structure

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Maintain clear hierarchy for learning materials
- Prioritize readability with appropriate spacing and typography
- Ensure consistent padding and margins across breakpoints
